To set up new lightsail server (which can host multiple websites):

log into aws console
Services ->  EC2 -> Lightsail

Make static ip address:
Networking -> create static ip
choose virginia zone

give it a name like l1.pacew.org-IP (you can't change it later, and it
shouldn't be the exact domain name)

go to the dns provider for the server name and set the static ip address

Create Instance
set zone to Virginia
set platform to Linux/Unix
set blueprint to Apps+OS Node.js
launch script should be empty

select your key under ssh key pair (if you haven't already, choose
Create New and upload your main ssh public rsa key)

choose the lowest priced tier

give it the name for the underlying server (e.g. l1.pacew.org ) 
(you can't change it later)

create; wait about a minute for it to go to state running

go to Lightspeed home, click on the instance, then Networking assign
it the static ip

on instance -> network, add port range 8000-9999 to list (22, 80, and
443 will be automatically added when apcahe starts)

run ./ls-setup SERVERNAME
unlocking your ssh private key a couple of times, if prompmted

reboot the server after the packages are installed. this also
activates the port range

================================================================

to make a database

create postgres db

on RDS detail page:
host is under endpoint
username is under username
password as supplied (in private file)
initial db name is under "DB name"

psql --host=main.czuqd0u2qqew.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com --username=master --password=M0lwLidF1w --dbname=maindb
